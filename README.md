All rights reserved to developer Mr. Yasser Dalouzi.

This project was created using source code and a template from codeastro.com and revised by Group 6.

Due to the large number of files, I uploaded them in a zip file. I apologize for the inconvenience, the zip file needs to be extracted twice.
Local server environment used: XAMPP (includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl)

We, Group 6, apologize for not creating our source code. We are genuinely grateful for all our gathered resources and believe they deserve proper credit.
